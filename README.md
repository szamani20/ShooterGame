Multi threading, concurrency and socket programming example in java(fx).
First run server and then run client. You need java8 to run the program, however you can convert lambda expressions into
anonymous inner classes and then it's executable with java7. I tried to use javafx Timeline instead of java.util.Timer 
and i found it less effective so that i used java.util.Timer
